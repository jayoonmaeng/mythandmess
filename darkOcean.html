        Since I was a kid, I was always wanted to be an artist in any way. My
        mom wanted me to play piano really well but I wasn't that talented in
        piano. so next, I played a guitar then my mom who is super conservative
        person gave me a gayaguem(Korean traditional string instrument). but I
        thought I'm not a patient person to polishing up myself for a long time
        with instrument so I shifted my interest to a painting. luckily I got
        accepted to art high school, art university, I was quite a good student
        as doing all the assignments and presence but deep inside it make me
        feel like I'm not an artist person.

        I've been studying art and its various forms for a long time now, but
        lately, I'm not quite sure what I'm doing or where I'm headed. I know
        that all the small moments of practice and learning add up to shape me
        and improve my skills, but I often feel lost and melancholic. It's been
        almost 30 years since I started building my knowledge and experience,
        but lately, I feel like I can't keep up with the rapid changes in the
        world. Everyone else seems to be ahead of me, and I feel like I'm
        constantly falling behind, always needing to learn more just to keep up
        with the times.
