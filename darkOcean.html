    <div class="box1">well, everyone has their own stories. right?</div>
    <div class="boxall">
      <div class="box2">
        I use to hide from many people about my work. I don't intend to sealed
        things but I do sometimes. My last name is pretty unique, only 0.044% of
        Korean people have this last name. Also, my first name is not common
        like Jiyeon, Jiyoon... so if you google my name, you can literally see
        my information on result. even my family who have Maeng as their last
        name have person with the same name. and my mom used to search my name
        online to see what do I do in my life. franckly it is working to my mom.
        you can easily find my report that I submitted to my former school about
        exchange student program, University acceptance interview on academy
        blog. I always dislike my name because of these reasons. I think this is
        the starting of hesitating to publish something online about myslef. I
        am still scared that who find my record and judging my artwork or life
        stories. I don't post my work on SNS, only a few big working is posted
        now. Lately I am trying to expose myself as an artist, or designer on
        SNS but it is not easy for me.

        I was always wanted to be an artist in any way. My mom wanted me to play
        piano really well but I wasn't that talented in piano. so next, I played
        a guitar then my mom who is super conservative person gave me a
        gayaguem(Korean traditional string instrument). but I thought I'm not a
        patient person to polishing up myself for a long time with instrument so
        I shifted my interest to a painting. luckily I got accepted to art high
        school, art university, I was quite a good student as doing all the
        assignments and presence but deep inside it make me feel like I'm not an
        artist person. Because other friends were running into deep in their
        interests and sticking to it all the time. then now they all have their
        own brand or work of identities. On the other hans, I can only collect
        my work as self- archiving stuffs I went to many school to study hard
        and got some average to high score in script which means I submitted
        usual work on deadline. I've been studying art and its various forms for
        a long time now, but lately, I'm not quite sure what I'm doing or where
        I'm headed. I know that all the small moments of practice and learning
        add up to shape me and improve my skills, but I often feel lost and
        melancholic. It's been almost 30 years since I started building my
        knowledge and experience, but lately, I feel like I can't keep up with
        the rapid changes in the world. Everyone else seems to be ahead of me,
        and I feel like I'm constantly falling behind, always needing to learn
        more just to keep up with the times. this feeling make me so depressed
        and undermine morale as well.

      <div class="box4">
        First day, when I decided to leave all the work I was doing before, I
        didn't think I'm available to do something creative or visually cool
        stuff. I always hide into somewhere like school, academy to learn or
        study something fun. 나는 항상 다른 사람들이 보기에 멋있고 좋은 것들을
        배운다는 핑계로 학교나 학원으로 숨어버리는 것 같다. 왜냐하면 나의
        나약하고 멋지지 못한 모습들을 남들이 알까봐 두렵기 때문이다. 타인의
        칭찬을 칭찬으로 받아들이지 못하고 내 실력이 들통날까봐 조마조마 하면서도
        그들에게 인정받기 위해 더 열심히 하려 한다. 거기서부터가 문제였을까?
        내가 무언가를 시작하는 원동력이 결국엔 내 자신이 아니라 타인에게서
        나온다는 사실. '나의 것'을 하고 싶다고 항상 이야기 하지만 나는 정작
        무엇을 하고 싶은지, 하려고 했는지 기억하지 못한다. 누군가는 이해할 수
        없는 상태. 항상 부정적으로 생각하고 융통성이 부족하다고 생각할 수도
        있다. 나는 어떤 상태에서 벗어나는걸 거부하는 것 같다. I know it's just
        so ugly when I find out I'm at the deepest point in myself, sometimes
        it's so cringe. 감정이라는 것이 얼마나 잔혹한지 하루하루 나를 쥐고
        마구잡이로 흔든다. 그 곡선의 가장 위와 아래 지점에 닿을 때면 손을 쓸 수
        없이 매복되어 아무 것도 할 수 없는 상태가 된다. it's just so exhausted
        and feel hopeless or too hight to doing static stuff. also these
        feelings make me hurt my body physically, my healthiness is getting
        worse and weak.
      </div>
      <div class="box5">
        I am so sure I will be fine for good. even if I could fall down a lot on
        the ground, I will try to change myself to heading inside of me, not
        other people. I believe that I can be so strong enough to stand in front
        of the world.

          Here, right here, the bottom of this deep black page, I left all my
          weak thought and gloomy story,<br />I hope I can be on track where I
          was falling from. maybe it's time to go up on the bright side.
