    <div class="box1">well, everyone has their own stories. right?</div>
    <div class="boxall">
      <div class="box2">
        Since I was a kid, I was always wanted to be an artist in any way. My
        mom wanted me to play piano really well but I wasn't that talented in
        piano. so next, I played a guitar then my mom who is super conservative
        person gave me a gayaguem(Korean traditional string instrument). but I
        thought I'm not a patient person to polishing up myself for a long time
        with instrument so I shifted my interest to a painting. luckily I got
        accepted to art high school, art university, I was quite a good student
        as doing all the assignments and presence but deep inside it make me
        feel like I'm not an artist person. Because other friends were running
        into deep in their interests and sticking to it all the time. then now
        they all have their own brand or work of identities. On the other hans,
        I can only collect my work as self- archiving stuffs I went to many
        school to study hard and got some average to high score in script which
        means I submitted usual work on deadline. I've been studying art and its
        various forms for a long time now, but lately, I'm not quite sure what
        I'm doing or where I'm headed. I know that all the small moments of
        practice and learning add up to shape me and improve my skills, but I
        often feel lost and melancholic. It's been almost 30 years since I
        started building my knowledge and experience, but lately, I feel like I
        can't keep up with the rapid changes in the world. Everyone else seems
        to be ahead of me, and I feel like I'm constantly falling behind, always
        needing to learn more just to keep up with the times. this feeling make
        me so depressed and undermine morale as well.

        First day, when I decided to leave all the work I was doing before, I
        didn't think I'm available to do something creative or visually cool
        stuff. I always hide into somewhere like school, academy to learn or
        study something fun 나는 항상 다른 사람들이 보기에 멋있고 좋은 것들을
        배운다는 핑계로 학교나 학원으로 숨어버리는 것 같다. 왜냐하면 나의
        나약하고 멋지지 못한 모습들을 남들이 알까봐 두렵기 때문이다. 타인의
        칭찬을 칭찬으로 받아들이지 못하고 내 실력이 들통날까봐 조마조마 하면서도
        기뻐하고 더 열심히 하려 한다. 거기서부터가 문제였을까? 내가 무언가를
        시작하는 원동력이 결국엔 내 자신이 아니라 타인에게서 나온다는 사실.
        '나의 것'을 하고 싶다고 항상 이야기 하지만 나는 정작 무엇을 하고 싶은지,
        하려고 했는지 기억하지 못한다. 누군가는 이해할 수 없는 상태. 항상
        부정적으로 생각하고 융통성이 부족하다고 생각할 수도 있다. 나는 어떤
        상태에서 벗어나는걸 거부하는 것 같다. I know it's just so ugly when I
        find out I'm at the deepest point in myself, sometimes it's so cringe.

      <div class="box4">
        감정이라는 것이 얼마나 잔혹한지 하루하루 나를 쥐고 마구잡이로 흔든다. 그
        곡선의 가장 위와 아래 지점에 닿을 때면 손을 쓸 수 없이 매복되어 아무
        것도 할 수 없는 상태가 된다. it's just so exhausted and feel hopeless or
        too hight to doing static stuff.

          Here, right here, on this darkblue-colored page, if I left all my weak
          thought and gloomy story,I hope I can be on track I was falling from.
